# Rutgers-Module1

## Task

Provided with starter code, we were tasked with refactoring the code for Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. 

Refracting code in this project consisted of

  * Adding alt attributes to the images
  * Changing single-used HTML classes to IDs 
  * Moving an image from CSS into HTML 
  * Cleaning up duplicate CSS
  * Changing current divs to more semantic HTML tags.

Additionally, this will need to be deployed to  GitHub pages.
